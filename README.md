# pyfastmath

🚀 **pyfastmath** is a blazing-fast math utility module for Python, written in C for maximum performance.
It includes essential number-theoretic functions like GCD, primality checking, modular exponentiation and many more. Check below for more information about the features.

## ✨ Features

*  `gcd(a, b)` – Compute the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers
*  `is_prime(n)` – Efficiently check if a number is prime
*  `mod_exp(base, exp, mod)` – Perform Modular Exponentiation: (base^exp) % mod
*  `lcm(a, b)` – Calculate the Lowest Common Multiplicant
*  `factorial(n)` – Calculate the factorial of a positive integer
*  `ncr(n, r)` – Calculate the combination of two number(nCr)
*  `npr(n, r)` – Calculate the permutation of two number(nPr)
